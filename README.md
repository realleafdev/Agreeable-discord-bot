This is a very simple project.
It requires ollama to be installed and running in the background.
If you're unsure if ollama is running in the background run
'ollama serve' in the terminal
The config file is where you can change all the settings of the bot without needing to touch the original code.
This project *might* work, I didn't spend much time testing it though and it's really sloppy cause I just slapped
ollama into the discord.js guide.

A few key things to note is that the json file doesn't support multi line strings, so just add spaces seperating each new line instead of new lines.
And again, I am very new to this and might have screwed things up a lot.
